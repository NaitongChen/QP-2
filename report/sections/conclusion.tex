\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
To summarize, RA-lasso is a regression estimator that is designed for sparse high-dimensional mean regression problems that can handle heavy-tailed and asymmetric error distributions. In particular, it is able to achieve a similar level of L2-loss between the true regression estimator and the estimates compared to LASSO using fewer noise predictors. The quality of the variables selected is similar that of PENSE. Although further simulation studies need to be performed to validate the rate of convergence of RA-lasso as we increase the number of observations, our revised simulation study in this report shows that RA-lasso provides high quality mean regression coefficient estimates under practical settings.
